                The current education system within the United States does not adequately cover the entire population.

            <li>
            The system as it stands is not able to support the segment of the population that is below average in education.

                Due to the failure within the current system, and the current standard of having a college degree, there is a distinct lack of social mobility for those affected by the failures of the system. As such the problem is perpetuated and should be addressed.

            <li class="collection-item"><div>Dear Secretary DeVos,
I believe that there are fundamental issues with our education system as it stands right now. After being presented with information regarding the income of students who received GED’s compared to those who had the opportunity to finish high school the wage gap between the groups is appalling.  Multiple studies by the United States government have highlighted the inequalities between students, and how these inequalities create a barrier when trying to move up within society. I urge you to take a critical look at education within impoverished communities and consider revamping school districts to help minimize education inequality because of income.
Sincerely,
A Concerned Citizen
